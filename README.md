# HashTables

#1 x % n where n is a large prime number because the number is unique unlike the other option

#2 This wouldn't be a good hash function becasue some number values could have the samne int values due to it being %599

#3 Keys and values are but in buckets. When the hashmap gets more and more stuff in it the code can take a lot longer and perform quite a bit worse. The keys and values can be null but can be filled with values. When buckets are made and filled it needs a lot more time to work.
